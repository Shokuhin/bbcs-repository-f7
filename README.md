## Functionalities + explanation of code
Our website generates 7 random examples of traditions around the world, including an image, a title, its origin country, and a description. After viewing the information shown, users can randomise another 7 examples using the refresh button at the bottom of the page.
Users can search for specific information by using the search bar at the top. The search function is case-insensitive, and the website outputs up to 7 examples with the keyword in its country name, title, or description.
Users may also submit examples of their own. The media link provided by the user is checked for format validity and submissions with an accepted image or video format will be acccepted. If a field in the submission is left blank, the submission will be rejected. Otherwise, the submission is pushed to dataarrays in index.js and may appear when the refresh button is pressed.
We also advocate against vaping.

## AI usage
- We used AI for most of the CSS (besides the anti-vaping ads)
- AI was also used as a learning tool, to ask questions. E.g. "is there a function that can..."
- For that one satire post about modern coders, AI was used for the description
- Proudly, AI was **not used** for html and javascript!

## Writeup(to be submitted in google form)
"Save the world" is a very high expectation for a website. Those around us had varying interpretations of it, from destroying asteroids to designing a Superman vs Batman game. Lost, confused, and stumped, we surfed the internet for unexpected problems plaguing our world. When the prospect of our project seemed as dark as the plumes of soot rising from factories, Charis said something ingenius: 'Not enough people know how to make bread'. Bread? Traditional bread. Are other traditions at risk of being lost too? What was originally the source of laughter thus became the spark for our (revolutionary) idea: A social media site for traditions.

However, our road was certainly not a smooth one. The three of us, inexperienced, faced problems left and right. The first major hurdle was getting to know each other, which took a while to say the least as we were all quite shy. As quickly as we started typing our html code, we whipped out our google searchbars. The first major code-related hurdle was definitely the searchbar, ironoically. IT JUST DIDNT WORK. The second major code-related hurdle was the random generation of the posts. Naturally, we overcame these challenges the way any coder would: Troubleshooting. And more troubleshooting. Having started early, time was not a concern. Nearing the end of our project, we have certainly gained valuable coding skills, strong bonds, and a phobia of error messages. If given the chance to go back in time, we would undoubtedly still choose to go for this hackathon!
